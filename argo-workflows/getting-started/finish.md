Let's recap:

* Argo Workflows is a workflow engine for Kubernetes.
* A workflow is a **Kubernetes resource**, so you can use `kubectl` to manage them.
* The user interface allows you to create and view workflows in a web browser.
* The CLI also allows to create and view workflows, but in the console.
